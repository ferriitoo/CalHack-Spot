## Description

GrabThisSpot is about effortlessly guiding a robot's every move, from navigating complex terrains to performing intricate tasks, simply by using your own body's language. No cumbersome controllers or intricate programming requiredâ€”just the innate expressiveness of your hands and body. This project is dedicated to realizing this vision, pushing the boundaries of technological innovation, and ultimately enhancing the adaptability and accessibility of robotic systems.

## Built with

The project is built on the foundation of the SPOT robot from Boston Dynamics, harnessing Python and the Flask web framework for development. Key components include computer vision techniques such as pose estimation (MediaPipe by Google) and facial recognition, facilitated by deep learning models. These technologies allow users to control the SPOT robot through natural hand gestures and movements. The integration of various sensors and robust communication protocols ensures real-time responsiveness and reliability, promising to revolutionize human-robot interaction by making it more intuitive and accessible across diverse applications and industries.
